   AlphaBit club is the first club in ESI-SBA, and one of the largest ones in Algeria. We are a diverse community with students from all over Algeria who are motivated to learn from each other and share their knowledge in Computer Science. <br>
  AlphaBit Club is a safe environment where students can have fun and have a rest away from studies pressure. <br>
  Currently We have around 170 active member + Alumni, and our community is still growing :smiley:

  2. History :sparkles:
</h2>

<p align="left" width="100%">
    In 2016, a group of ESI-SBA students wanted to have a community where they can help each other and have fun... and that's how the club was founded. <br>
  When AlphaBit was founded, the founders set a goal, they wanted each year to be better than the previous one, they wanted to always keep improving what can be improved... Hence our slogan: <strong>Raise The Bar Higher</strong> :blue_heart: 
</p>
