# DESIGN PATTERNS

## 1. What Are They?

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## 2. Benefits of patterns

Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

## 3. What does the pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

* **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
* **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
* **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
* **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

## 3. Classification

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

* **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
* **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
* **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Here is a list of 22 classic design patterns, grouped by their intent.
